Mneson code by Marius from 2005.

It is "organized" in two "versions" numbered IV and V, but the versioning is "complex", as IV contains a more recent revision_history.txt file.

To understand the real differences a proper analysis would be required, possibly using diff on all different source files.

But my bet is on IV, as V seems like a fork for an experiment.

The ZIP files contain homonym directories as found on a backup of my computer, with everything in them: source code, object code for Mac or maybe Linux, binary data files with extension .mn, and documents in HTML or other formats.
